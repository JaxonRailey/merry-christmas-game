This was my way of wishing Merry Christmas to my contacts, trying to give them a moment of fun.

It's a mini-game that can be played entirely on a browser, the goal of the game is to discover the lock code by following the clues below the gift. If the code is correct, you will notice right away, the package will shake and a sound will be emitted.

:egg: **If you open it from your computer's browser, you can see some Easter eggs in the console.**

The ```generate.html``` page is used to create the URL to send, you can enter the name of the person you want to wish, so as to have a personalized message.

I also thought about those who have little time to think about it: by clicking three times on your name present on the gift, a solution number will be auto-filled, but honestly I hope that this functionality is used as little as possible.

Enjoy and... Merry Christmas :santa:

:star: **If you liked what I did, if it was useful to you or if it served as a starting point for something more magical let me know with a star** :green_heart:
